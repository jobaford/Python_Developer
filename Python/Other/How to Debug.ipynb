    "### ‚ùå Nobody Writes Perfect Code\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs impossible to write perfect code the first time.\n",
    "All code has **mistakes**, also called **bugs** or **errors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These bugs usually show up **when your program runs** ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we call them **runtime errors** or **exceptions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding and fixing these errors is called **debugging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even **senior developers** spend a big part of their time debugging ‚Äî either fixing their own code or someone else‚Äôs.\n",

    "### ‚úÖ How to Get Better at Debugging\n",

    "## üí° My Debugging Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Use Linting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linting** checks your code for issues *before you even run it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If you write `num + 4` but never defined `num`, a linter will show a red underline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PyCharm** (has linting built-in)\n",
    "* **VS Code** or **Sublime Text** (add extensions like `pylint`)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Use a Good Code Editor or IDE**\n",
    "\n",
    "IDEs like **PyCharm** or editors like **VS Code** give you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax highlighting**\n",
    "* **Auto-formatting with PEP 8**\n",
    "* **Error detection before running code**\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes spotting errors **much easier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Learn to Read Error Messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs say you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "4 + \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôll get this error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "#### üîß How to Use It\n",

    "    return num1 + num2\n",
    "\n",
    "add(4, \"five\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this, the program **stops at `set_trace()`**, and you enter an interactive debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can type commands like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "num1        # shows 4\n",
    "num2        # shows \"five\"\n",
